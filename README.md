# Drowsiness Detection
### Detection system to prevent drowsiness scenarios in manned vehicles.

This project works using jupyter notebook, in Google Colab. If u want to use a local jupyter notebook instead of colab, u have to change the absolute paths to ur own paths.

The main file is "Drowsiness _detection.ipynb". 
The rest of files are model implementations, necessary to the proper functioning of the system (They have to be in the same folder).

"documentation.pdf" is a pdf format file which explains how the system works (the document is written in Spanish).

Its necessary to download the yolov3 model from this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gtbk3l-dHZmyvdOzl9-3wTIKb0TVfJd3?usp=sharing) and put it in the main folder too.
